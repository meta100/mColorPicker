h2. Usage

<pre>$('input.foo').mColorPicker({
  hex: true,
  imageFolder: '/where/should/go'
})</pre>

Options:

* *imageFolder* - Change to move image location. Defaults to <pre>images/</pre>
* *swatches* - Initial colors in the swatch, must an array of 10 colors.
* *hex* - true or false. Defaults to <pre>false</pre>.

You can call these before applying it to an object for other options

* *$.fn.mColorPicker.init.enhancedSwatches* - Turn of saving and loading of swatch to cookies.
* *$.fn.mColorPicker.init.allowTransparency* - Turn off transperancy as a color option.
* *$.fn.mColorPicker.init.showLogo* - Turn on/off the meta100 logo (You don't really want to turn it off, do you?).

h2. What the fork?

I forked this to change the following:

* remove auto application of color picker. It caused a problem when trying to change the imageFolder - the CSS images were still looking in the default folder.
* added the hex option
* doesn't blow up if there's no trailing slash in the imageFolder option
